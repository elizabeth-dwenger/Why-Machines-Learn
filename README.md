# Why Machines Learn - Implementing ML Models from Scratch

This repository documents my attempt to implement each machine learning model introduced in **"Why Machines Learn"** by Anil Ananthaswamy ([link to my notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hrf53c2MieounLZvZdI0nRKwXyUtg-Wa3mZUfLjJJ7M/edit?usp=sharing)) as a means to deepen my understanding. This is done **from scratch**, without relying on libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

Each notebook corresponds to a chapter or topic covered in the book.

1. **Chapter 1 & 2**: Perceptron
2. **Chapter 3**: Gradient Descent
3. **Chapter 4**: Naive Bayes
4. **Chapter 5**: KNN
5. **Chapter 6**: PCA
6. **Chapter 7**: SVM; Kernel Trick
7. **Chapter 8**: Hopfield Network 
8. **Chapter 9 & 10**: MLP; Activation Functions; Backpropagation

**To be continued**
